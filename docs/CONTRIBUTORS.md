# CONTRIBUTORS

Thank you for considering contributing to the project! üéâ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project is a light weight hobby project. It is intended to have a low barrier for entry when it comes to contributing to it. The author of this repository is committed to approach all contributions in good faith and respect. However the ultimate decision what to include into the project stays with the author of the repository.  

Before you go too deep into the process, have a look at the [README-file](https://github.com/hkionline/verso.cli) to get a general idea of the project.

## How to

The following sub-sections instructs how to make the most common types of contributions. If you feel something is missing from the instructions, feel free to create an issue. If you are very new to coding, tools like git and contributing to project have a look at the Resources and Documentation -section below.

### Issues

An issue is where contributions start. Have a look at the "Issues" section of the repository and identify the issue you'd like to contribute to. **Contributions come in many forms**. They are not always code. A contribution can be as simple as a comment in an existing issue. If you however want to contribute code, there must be a issue for the contribution. If there isn't, you can create one. The **issue is then reviewed** by the author.

Make sure the description sufficiently **explains the issue**. At the moment there is no template for the issues.

**Not all issues are accepted** in the end. Don't feel bad about it. Your idea might have been good but it just didn't fit the idea of the project or the timing might have been wrong for instance. Issues which are not accepted will be closed.

**Issues should be labeled** for easier identification.
Issues labeled "help wanted" are free game for contributions. Comment in the issue, you'd like to work on the issue and get an acknowledgement from the repository owner. You can start working before the acknowledgement but its just good to have so others will know someone is already working on the issue and the repository owner is aware of that.

If you are looking for a simple issue to start with, look for the **"good first issue"** label. 

**Summary**:
- Anyone can create issues
- Make sure the issue describes the matter sufficiently
- Issues are reviewed by the repository owner or assigned contributor(s)
- Issues which are not accepted by the project are closed
- Issues should be labelled

### Pull Requests

New code, configurations and documentation are added to the project via [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Pull request must be connected to an existing issue.

You'll work in your own branch and when your changes are completed you can make a pull request to the main branch of this repository.

If you add new code, it must include tests for the code and the existing tests must also pass. If the new code changes behaviour and existing tests are broken they must be fixed before a pull request can be merged.

In cases where the pull request does not add new code, adding tests is not needed unless the addition affects the code base in some way. All existing tests must still pass.  

Finally you must always update the CHANGELOG.md of the project. The format in the changelog is based on "[keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)",
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Summary**:
- PRs must be based on an issue
- PRs must include tests for new code
- All tests must pass
- Changelog must be updated with a new version
